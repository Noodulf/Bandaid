🚀 Revolutionizing Remote Collaboration: Interactive Pointer Control

I'm excited to share a project I’ve been working on—a Chrome extension that brings remote collaboration to life by enabling real-time pointer control on another user's screen!

💡 How It Works:
🔗 Two devices connect seamlessly through a 6-digit PIN, managed via a custom Glitch-hosted server.
🖱️ Once connected, the sender can control a pointer on the receiver’s screen, enabling:

Hovering over interactive elements.
Simulating clicks to engage with elements directly.
📡 Key Highlights:

Built with socket-based communication for ultra-low latency and smooth interactions.
Compatible with Google Meet for screen sharing during collaborative sessions.
All events and interactions are manually crafted to ensure precision and responsiveness.
🌟 Future Roadmap:

Further optimization to enhance performance and reduce latency.
Expanding to include keyboard input controls for typing on the receiver’s screen.
This extension opens up new possibilities for remote support, interactive presentations, and collaboration. It’s all about making digital interactions more intuitive and effective.
